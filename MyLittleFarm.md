## Game essence
- **The essence of the MyLittleFarm mini-game** is for players to develop a farm by buying plants, animals, and structures. 

- The farm is divided into sub-locations, each with its NPC and specific active tasks. These NPCs will be unlocked as the player progresses through the questline.

- There will be a **questline** on the farm, which is essentially a **task system**.

- Tasks will **replace** achievements, providing a monetary reward for quest completion (similar to achievements).

- After completing a specific questline, a new location with a new NPC and active task will be unlocked.

- The NPC, in turn, will give the player a new questline.

- The **goal** of the game remains unchanged: to buy everything on the farm (which, by the way, will only be possible by completing the full list of quests).

- The **core mechanics** remain the same: players buy crops that generate a certain income per second, and the game still remains semi-AFK simulator.
## Active Task System
### General Principles
**List** of active tasks in the mode: grass breaking, tree cutting, mining, fishing, cargo hauling.

Tasks such as **grass breaking** and cargo **hauling will** be upgraded through a menu for a certain amount.

For other tasks, **player statistics** are introduced. The player will have the following characteristics: **tree cutting, mining, and fishing**.

At the beginning of the game, each characteristic starts at level 0. By performing the corresponding active task, the player can increase their characteristics. 

The characteristics determine the **speed of tree chopping** (for lumberjacking), the **speed of ore breaking** (for mining), and **the speed of fish catching** (for fishing). 

The maximum level for each characteristic is 50. Every 10 levels, the player takes their tool to the **workshop**, where it is upgraded for money and a certain amount of time (preventing the pumping of the characteristic to level 50 on the first day). 

If the player tries to work with the old tool after reaching the level where they need to upgrade it, they will not gain experience for the task, preventing the player's development in both experience and the appearance of acquired resources.

#### Fatigue

There will be a **fatigue mechanic**. The player will have a fatigue value, initially set to zero. Each block mined adds +1 to the fatigue value, which gradually decreases (-1 every two seconds if the player is not breaking anything). 

The value will start decreasing after 10 seconds when the player stops breaking blocks, decreasing by one unit every 2 seconds. 

When the player increases the fatigue value by breaking a block, fatigue will be added at the following values, preventing the player from breaking blocks:
- 240-260 - 1%
- 260-280 - 3%
- 300-320 - 5%
- 320-340 - 10%
- 340-360 - 15%
- 360-380 - 20%
- 380-399 - 25%
- 400 - 100%

Fatigue is relieved when the fatigue value reaches 100.

### Grass Breaking

The player has grown grass in their barn, and their sole task is to cut it. 

### Cargo Hauling

There are four warehouses from which the player carries a cargo block to a truck. For each delivered block, the player receives a certain amount of money. 

The amount depends on the weight of the cargo and the distance between the warehouse from which the cargo was carried and the truck. 

The box is randomly issued to a random warehouse and has a random weight.

For money (similar to grass), the player improves characteristics such as **cargo value** (affects the amount of money from one cargo, like a modifier) and **cargo capacity** (allows the player to move faster, i.e., reduces the slowdown coefficient).

### Lumberjacking

In the northern part of the map, there is a forest where the player can harvest wood. The player has an axe. 

When the player reaches every 10th level (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), the axe can be upgraded in the workshop for money and time. 

The lumberjacking characteristic affects the speed of tree chopping, and the appearance of the axe affects the appearance of the chopped trees.

When chopping a tree, the player obtains the appearance of that tree. The wood will be used for building structures, completing quests, and upgrading tools.

Types of trees and types of axes used to chop them:

- Oak (initial axe)
- Birch (axe with level 10)
- Spruce (axe with level 20)
- Dark Oak (axe with level 30)
- Acacia (axe with level 40)
- Tropical Tree (axe with level 50)

### Mining

Through the forest, there are five scattered mines/caves. In the mine, players extract ores that are processed in the workshop into corresponding ingots, stones, and more. 

The player has a pickaxe. When the player reaches every 10th level (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), the pickaxe can be upgraded in the workshop for money and time. 

The mining characteristic affects the speed of extracting minerals, and the appearance of the pickaxe affects the appearance of the extracted ores. 

Ores spawn in mines with a certain percentage and depending on the pickaxe level (only ores that the player can break spawn).

Additionally, ingots, alloys, stones, and more are used in constructions, quests, and jewelry making. In the workshop, from certain resources from the mine, players can create **precious jewelry** and sell them for money.

Types of ores, their smelting, and types of pickaxes used to break them:

- **Stone** (without smelting). Broken with the initial pickaxe. Used in construction.
- **Coal** (without smelting). Broken with the initial pickaxe. Used in the workshop as fuel (in smelting).
- **Iron Ore → Iron Ingot** (10 iron ore, 1 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 10. Used in construction and jewelry making.
- **Copper Ore → Copper Ingot** (10 copper ore, 1 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 10. Used in construction and jewelry making.
- **Silver Ore → Silver Ingot** (10 silver ore, 2 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 20. Used in jewelry making.
- **Quartz Ore → Quartz** (10 quartz ore, 2 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 20. Used in construction.
- **Gold Ore → Gold Ingot** (10 gold ore, 3 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 30. Used in jewelry making and construction.
- **Amethyst Ore → Amethyst** (10 amethyst ore, 3 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 30. Used in jewelry making.
- **Platinum Ore → Platinum** (10 platinum ore, 4 coal, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 40. Used in construction and jewelry making.
- **Emerald Ore → Emerald** Broken with a pickaxe at level 40 (10 emerald ore, 4 coal, 1 minute). Used in jewelry making.
- **Titanium Ore → Titanium Ingot** (10 titanium ore, 5 coals, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 50. Used in construction.
- **Diamond Ore → Diamond** (10 diamond ore, 5 coals, 1 minute). Broken with a pickaxe at level 50. Used in jewelry making.

### Fishing

The player has 8 types of fish that can be caught with one fishing rod. 

Fish do not differ in any parameters except for their name; their value is calculated based on a **fixed multiplier** multiplied by passive income and the **weight modifier**. 

The **weight modifier** at level 0 has a range of 0.9-1.1, with each level adding 0.01 to the boundaries (0.91-1.11 at level 1, and so on). 

That is, leveling up gives a modifier addition to weight. Upon upgrading the fishing rod, the player unlocks new 8 types of fish that are more expensive (**higher fixed multiplier**) and continues to improve the weight modifier.

Changes to the fishing mechanics: when a fish is hooked, a meter appears at the bottom (between the HP and hunger bars, above the experience bar) showing when it is best to reel it in (from green to red). 

If reeled in too early or too late, the fish will escape or the line will break. The weight of the fish should determine the difficulty and timer to catch it using this mechanism. 

The difficulty of catching depends not just on the weight but on how this weight relates to the range of your current caught weight (i.e., 1.1 with a weight range of 0.9 and 1.1 is difficult, while 1.2 with a weight range of 1.2 and 1.4 is easy). 

Also, with a low chance, the player can catch trash that will be worth nothing.

The player enters fishing through the NPC fisherman Henry on their farm, and returns home through NPC fisherman Henry at the fishing spot.

## Weather and New Event System

The farm will now have weather that directly affects the chance of events occurring. The weather consists of two components: **temperature** and **precipitation**.

### Temperature
The temperature fluctuates between -30 and +30 degrees Celsius depending on the season, with specific ranges for each month. The temperature on a given day is **x**, and it changes with the following probabilities:

- x - 5: 3%
- x - 4: 5%
- x - 3: 7%
- x - 2: 10%
- x - 1: 15%
- x: 20%
- x + 1: 15%
- x + 2: 10%
- x + 3: 7%
- x + 4: 5%
- x + 5: 3%

If the result of this formula exceeds the temperature range for that month, the temperature changes to the same value but with the opposite sign (for example, if at -28 with a limit of -30 the temperature falls to -32, it becomes -24 instead).

At the start of the next month, the temperature is checked to see if it fits within the range for that month. If not, the temperature is set to the closest value within the range (e.g., the boundary).

Below are the months and their temperature ranges:

- **January**: Upper limit: -5, Lower limit: -30
- **February**: Upper limit: +5, Lower limit: -20
- **March**: Upper limit: +10, Lower limit: -10
- **April**: Upper limit: +15, Lower limit: 0
- **May**: Upper limit: +20, Lower limit: +5
- **June**: Upper limit: +25, Lower limit: +10
- **July**: Upper limit: +30, Lower limit: +15
- **August**: Upper limit: +25, Lower limit: +10
- **September**: Upper limit: +20, Lower limit: +5
- **October**: Upper limit: +15, Lower limit: 0
- **November**: Upper limit: +10, Lower limit: -5
- **December**: Upper limit: 0, Lower limit: -25

### Precipitation
Precipitation has three categories: sunny, cloudy, or precipitation (rain/snow; rain if temperature ≥ 0, snow if temperature < 0). The type of precipitation will be chosen with specific probabilities for each month:

- **January**: Sunny – 30%, Snow – 40%, Cloudy – 30%
- **February**: Sunny – 20%, Snow/Rain – 40%, Cloudy – 40%
- **March**: Sunny – 25%, Snow/Rain – 35%, Cloudy – 40%
- **April**: Sunny – 34%, Rain – 33%, Cloudy – 33%
- **May**: Sunny – 40%, Rain – 30%, Cloudy – 30%
- **June**: Sunny – 40%, Rain – 20%, Cloudy – 40%
- **July**: Sunny – 50%, Rain – 15%, Cloudy – 35%
- **August**: Sunny – 40%, Rain – 25%, Cloudy – 35%
- **September**: Sunny – 30%, Rain – 25%, Cloudy – 45%
- **October**: Sunny – 25%, Snow/Rain – 35%, Cloudy – 40%
- **November**: Sunny – 20%, Snow/Rain – 50%, Cloudy – 30%
- **December**: Sunny – 30%, Snow – 30%, Cloudy – 40%

### Special Weather Scenarios
The probabilities change under the following conditions:

- If it is sunny for 5 days in a row, the next day **cannot** be sunny. 2/3 of the probability for sun shifts to cloudy, and the rest to rain/snow.
- If it is cloudy for 5 days in a row, the next day **cannot** be cloudy. Half of the probability for cloudy shifts to sunny, and the other half to rain/snow.
- If there is rain/snow for 5 days in a row, the next day **cannot** have precipitation. 2/3 of the probability for rain/snow shifts to cloudy, and the rest to sunny.

### Event System

Events now have probabilities that depend on both temperature and weather. The chance of an event occurring will be checked every 30 minutes of player gameplay. If an event is triggered, it will appear to the player. After the event ends, there will be a cooldown (which continues even if the player is offline) until the next occurrence of the same event. Some events have durations, while others are removed in special ways.

Some events have a unique system, described individually.

The rest of the events follow a similar detailed structure, adjusting for chance, cooldowns, and specific weather conditions. Each event is designed to interact with both temperature and precipitation in meaningful ways.

### New Weather Component: Wind

#### Wind Characteristics
- **Direction**: 8 directions (North, South, West, East, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast). Technically, there is a ninth direction representing calmness (0 m/s wind speed).
- **Speed**: Ranges from 0 m/s to 20 m/s.
- **Daily Update**: At the start of each day, new wind speed and direction are set, alongside temperature and precipitation. 
- **Direction Selection**: The wind direction is chosen randomly, with the restriction that the same direction cannot occur for more than three consecutive days.
- **Speed Variation**: The wind speed is also set randomly within its range, with the restriction that it cannot change by more than 10 m/s from the previous day's value.

#### Player Speed Dependency on Wind
- **With Wind Direction**: If the player moves in the direction of the wind, their speed increases by \( \frac{x}{10} \) (where \( x \) is the wind speed in m/s).
- **45-Degree Angle**: If the player moves at a 45-degree angle to the wind direction, their speed increases by \( \frac{x \sqrt{2}}{20} \).
- **Perpendicular**: If the player moves perpendicular to the wind direction, their speed remains unchanged.
- **135-Degree Angle**: If the player moves at a 135-degree angle to the wind direction, their speed decreases by \( \frac{x \sqrt{2}}{20} \).
- **Against Wind Direction**: If the player moves against the wind direction, their speed decreases by \( \frac{x}{10} \).

### Event Drop Chance Updates
- The chance of event occurrence is checked every 10 minutes of gameplay instead of every 30 minutes.
- The cooldowns for event occurrences have been reduced as follows:

#### Cooldowns

The "Nightmares" event may occur, which resets income, stops production, processing, and export. 

It can be removed by "playing dead" and getting a drowned event, and then removing it.

Players receive 10 candies and a basket in their inventory. 

Players can poke another player once with a candy to give 1 candy (if you try to poke a player with candy again, they will refuse) into the basket of another player, and the basket will count the number of candies. 

From this, players will receive a local boost +0.1x from every 10th candy in their basket (1.1x booster with 10 candies, 1.2x with 20, etc.), local production speed increases by +2%, and local crop export speed increases by +2%.

| Frenchie | Cotton | With the first purchase, my friend! Trust me, cotton will come in handy. | Cotton products are often soft and fluffy. They're somewhat like me. | Not much green in the wallet won't add vegetation to the fields. | From now on, it's a cotton paradise! |

I hope it meets your expectations and helps create excellent beer! Feel free to reach out anytime. | Unfortunately, you don't have enough funds to buy so much hops.

| Sergio | Tomato | Finally, the day of tomatoes has come to this farm, amigo! | If you're interested, amigo, you're buying Catalan tomatoes, I guarantee. | In our region, around La Sima, such amusing proposals were punished. | Amigo, the garden is full of little tomatoes; move on! |
| Aly | Peony | I hope that acquiring a peony made you a little happier. | Seeing a smile on your face when buying a peony—that's why I'm here. | I don't like to talk about problems directly, but money... you don't have any. How do you plan to buy peonies? | This is all you can afford. I hope the peonies made you a little happier, as I intended! |
| Andrew | Currant | Welcome to my berry paradise! I hope we'll see each other more often. | What a joy that you continue to buy currants from me! In general, I love all kinds of berries. | For this amount, you should head to the forest to gather. | Having so much currant on the farm is already happiness; you definitely don't need more! |
| Tommy | Cinnamon | The farm is growing, flourishing, which means it's time to move on to trees! | Of course, we'll plant another tree, my little bun. | Sweet tooth, you can't buy trees on our farm just like that; you need to save up more. | All my territory is planted; it's time to plant something else. |
| Newton | Apple Tree | An apple on my head, and it's my first customer on this farm in many years! | Something is drawing you here, isn't it? | May an apple fall on you if you offer such a small amount again. | The strength is in our apple trees, but strength must be moderate, so I can't sell you more. |
| Natalie | Peach | You had enough for the first peach, I'm glad! | We sell the juiciest peaches on our farm! | You can take offense at such offers; it would be worth saving up a bit more... | There's no more space for peaches, unfortunately. |
| Mike | Pear | I knew you'd buy a pear! Who doesn't love pears, right? | The more trees, the more profit. Both for me and for you. | The pear is hanging, and you can't buy it. What's this? Right: not enough funds, buddy. | Now everyone can enjoy my delicious pears, hooray! |
| Alex | Orange | Oranges on our farm? Let's experiment. | People demand more citrus—people will get more citrus. | With such a balance, you can't demand anything from me, buddy. | The experiment was successful; the farm is now full of oranges. |

| Mathematician Rill | Sheep | Only the beauty of this sheep can compare to how beautiful mathematics is! | Sheep +1, there won't be any minuses | An interesting sophism: you can't give money, but you get a sheep. Where is the profit coming from? The solution is that I am in minus. | The pastures are filled with sheep! Thanks to them, your profit will grow in geometric progression! |
| Michael | Pig | A wonderful piglet has appeared on your farm, congratulations! | Oh, we have a new member! Another little piggy has joined our pen. | Our pink happiness is worth much more than what you're offering me. | That's enough, or they might start running away! |

We've been m-m-mooing eagerly for a new friend. | You're m-m-misunderstanding if you think I'll work with anyone for such money. | Moo-moo! Can't hear it? There's no more room for cows. | 
| Mario | Mushroom Cow | It's-a me, Mario! And this is the mushroom cow, my favorite animal! Don't think I'll let you buy such a wonder so cheap again - save up more. | Mamma mia, you're a true mushroom enthusiast, come again! | When things are going bad, there's no use trying to get something from me for free. Work for it, amico! | Mamma mia, I have nothing more to offer you, I'm just a simple plumber! |
| Teddy | Bees | Ouch, a bee stung me! This is your first beehive! Just make sure to come back, one is not enough. | I knew you'd be back. After all, honey is so wonderful, it lures you to spend... | I won't sell it for less! It's a matter of principle, you know. | We harvested the whole apiary! Where do you need more, aren't you afraid? |

| Smith | Workshop | These are pennies! Even a novice should have saved up more before trying to buy this from me. | A whole world of possibilities has opened up to you! | - |
| Auntie Gali | Bakery | And what do you expect me to do about it? At most, you can buy a pastry. | Come in here more often; we'll have the finest pastries here! | - |
| Daniel | Bar | Not that I'm a businessman, but with such funds, no proper business can be organized. | Congratulations! Let's celebrate this purchase; a place will appear soon. | - |
| John | Factory | I won't work here if that's all you can offer me. | To work, gentlemen! | - |

| Mika | Sewing Workshop | Go buy yourself a sewing machine for such a pittance. | Come by more often, stylish one! | - |
| Annie | Flower Shop | Is that all? I can only give you a comforting bouquet. | Long live our flower business! | - |

I don't see any benefit for myself now, we won't negotiate anymore. | Thanks for the money, now I'm taking it in this wonderful place! | And you laugh, saying, 'This won't be enough for me!' Sorry, little one, it won't work that way. |
| Frank | Golem Statue | No, friend, with such a set of resources, nothing can be erected. | Our farm became much calmer when such a solid hunk appeared! | One such statue is enough for our entire farm; don't overdo it with grandeur. |
| Geo | Globe | Pathetic amount. You can buy a tabletop one for it and spin it until you get bored. | I hope now there won't be any disputes among the locals about whether the Earth is perfectly round? What, meaning slightly flattened at the poles? | I don't see the point of having several such statues. Why didn't you notice something like that on the first one? | 
| Sol | Eternal Flame | Not enough resources for such a great monument, friend. | The right decision, my friend, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this. | One monument here is quite enough. |
| Mercy | Golden Angel | Not enough funds. The purchase is not given easily, but you have every chance to save up more and come back. | Thank you for your contribution to this statue. I am working at the peak of my abilities, everything is fine. | Where to go more? I can't handle it alone. |
| Lancelot | Sword of King Arthur | I see that a person like you is unworthy of such an exquisite monument. | Nice doing business with you, valiant warrior! Your Excalibur will be ready soon. | The sword is already in place and awaits its hero; I require nothing more from you. |
| Neytiri | Tree of Eywa | You lack what is needed. You are a stranger in this territory. | The sacred tree has rooted itself in this land! | The Great Mother preserves the balance of life, just as the balance on these lands. Possess this world anew, and chaos will befall us. |
| Helios | Colossus of Rhodes | You cannot attain the divine dimension until you master all that is necessary! | My respects, mortal! Now this place can truly be called a wonder of light! | My task here is done, our paths diverge from now on. I shall bless this land no more. |

## Quests
### General Principles
Quests come in two types: main quests, given by key NPCs in their respective locations, and additional (daily) quests to ensure a continuous and varied gaming experience.

Players can receive quests directly from NPCs or through a phone (donation item) with the option to choose an NPC.

If an NPC has a quest, a "!" icon will appear above them. Clicking on the NPC opens a semi-transparent black bar that fully describes the task and its basis. Then, a menu appears.

Quest types may include:
- Resource gathering (trees, ores)
- Bringing food/plants (to the warehouse)
- Giving money
- Delivering something to someone (letter, gift)
- Bringing a jewelry item (if the player has it in the workshop, it's deducted from the inventory)
- Purchasing something on the farm (if the player is at a stage where the NPC requests it)

The menu contains the task, reward, and the option to accept/decline the quest. 

Main NPC quests cannot be declined; they merely describe the quest, provide a task, and await completion.

### Questline

#### Introduction

The player appears in the central part of the village (at the train station), where the head of the village (**Mayor**) is located. The player approaches them, clicks, and a dialogue begins:

1. First Click:
**Mayor** - Greetings! I am the head of this village of farmers, "village_name". Around these parts, they call me the mayor, but friends call me the retiree!

2. Second Click:
**Mayor** - Since you're here, I'm sure you want to experience the life of a real farmer. To help you understand how everything works, you have the "Farmer's Diary" in your 9th inventory slot. There, you can find answers to any questions of interest. The information in the diary unfolds as you progress.

3. Third Click:
**Mayor** - I see you're eager to start. Head east along the path; there you'll see an old barn. Next to it is Granny; she seems to need help, and in general, she'll assist you in your endeavors. She has lived here her whole life.

#### Player approaches **Granny Lyuda**.

**Granny**: Hello, are you the newcomer everyone in the village has been gossiping about? Well, you definitely look like a city person. No worries, we'll toughen you up a bit.

**Granny**: You can start your farmer's journey in our village. To begin with, find some money for wheat, which Konstantinych sells. This way, you'll earn money from the crop. You can use the grass in the barn. **(Quest 1 - Buy the first wheat from Konstantin)**

1. After completing Quest 1:

**Granny**: Oh, thank you! I could use some extra hands. Though I might be stronger than you, old age still makes itself known. 

Listen, during the spring rains, the roof got damaged, well, the barn's roof, not mine. I need help fixing it, as the grass has completely dried out and isn't bringing in any profit. 

Take an axe, go to the forest, and chop down (N amount) oak trees. **(Quest 2 - Bring Granny 20 oak logs)**

5. After completing Quest 2:

**Granny**: Oh, thank you! Now the jokes about the roof falling off should finally end, I hope...

6. Quest 3:

**Granny**: Wow, so you've already bought more than 80 units of wheat. Each crop unlocks a specific processing method after 80 units. What is processing, and why is it needed? Processing is the active circulation of goods to get more benefits from the crop. For example, wheat can be turned into bread.
To the right of me is a bakery. You can buy it and start making bread. **(Quest 3 - Buy the bakery and give Granny 1 bread)**

7. After Quest 3:

**Granny**: Finally, your possibilities have expanded, and the game has become more diverse for you.

8. Quest 4:

**Granny**: Now you have enough for your first little animal. In our case, it's a chicken. It will lay eggs, which you can either sell or use in further processing.
Buy the first chicken and bring me 3 eggs for a pie, please. **(Quest 4 - Give Granny 3 eggs)**

9. After Quest 4:

**Granny**: I'm very grateful; you've helped out an old lady!

10. Quest 5:

**Granny**: Go to our fisherman; perhaps you'll find something else interesting besides farming. Try your hand at fishing; who knows, maybe it'll work out for you.

Walk straight from the barn until the very end, then turn right. Our local fisherman is standing there. Honestly, he's quite a catch; you'll recognize him right away. 

Too bad a berry like me isn't to his taste. (**Quest 5 - Find the fisherman Henry**)

11. Quest 6:

**Fisherman Henry**: Greetings, [player]! I've already heard about you. Rumors spread quickly in our village.

Henry: Want to try your hand at fishing? Come on, I'll show you how it's done. (teleports the player to fishing spot) [provides fishing guide]

12. After catching the first fish:

**Henry**: That's how it all happens. If you enjoy it, feel free to come by more often. It's quite a profitable venture. 

**(Quest 6 - Catch the first 5 fish)**. After completing the quest (catching the fifth fish), Henry teleports the player to his farm and gives the next quest.

13. Quest 7:

**Henry**: Catch me a couple of buckets of fish (20). Everyone in my family loves seafood. **(Quest 7 - Catch 20 fish)**.

**Henry**: Thank you so much; this will last us for a month. May Poseidon bless you for this service.

14. Quest 8:

**Henry**: A bit further from me is my friend, neighbor, comrade, and brother - Koryagin. He needs help, but today I wanted to go fishing.
 Go to him, ask what he wanted. Maybe your help will be enough.

- (after completing, triggers 1 random positive event according to the season) **(Quest 8 - Find Koryagin)**. 

After this dialogue, the player is allowed to teleport home from Henry.

15.  Quest 9:

**Koryagin**: Hey, hello! Did Henry send you? That lazy squid! Probably avoided some nonsense again.

**Koryagin**: Well, if they sent you, there's nothing to be done. You're quite a weakling... Hope you can handle it; the job is not an easy one. Ha-ha-ha, got it? Kind of heavy, ha-ha.

I deal with transporting goods from our village to the city, and I need help unloading. I can do it myself, but I want to see what city slickers like you can do.

**Koryagin**: What's with the hesitation?! Get on the bus, it's near the house, and let's go! [provides guide on cargo transportation] **(Quest 9 - Transport the first cargo)**
- (after completion, grants a 1.2x cargo transportation speed boost for an hour)

16. Quest 10:

**Koryagin**: Unload 25 crates and distribute them among the warehouses. Be careful with the cargo, possum. **(Quest 10 - Transport 25 cargos)**

**Koryagin**: You've become a bit stronger; I even respect you a little, rooster. Now you're ready to watch over this farm! I can give you a couple of useful tips for the road.

**Koryagin**: For example, you can move around the farm not only on foot, because I see it's a bit challenging for you. You can take any animal (button X) and ride on it. If you get lost somewhere, there's a shortcut to return to your farm (button Y). And if, by any chance, you manage to get lost here, you can use the map you have (**button M**).

#### End
- After completion of the last questline, provides a game week (7 hours) without negative events

## Mounts and Perks

### Mounts

1. **Horse**: Obtained from a wandering merchant who appears on the farm with a low chance (3%, checked at the beginning of each day). 

The merchant gives a quest, and upon completion, the player receives a horse. The merchant stops spawning after the player obtains a horse.

**Merchant's Quest**:

Greetings, landowner! I am a wandering merchant, roaming the world to make my fortune. Listen, on your farm, there is a forest with mines, and I didn't bring any tools for this journey. 

So, I propose a deal: gather resources for me, and I'll give you my horse to make it easier for you to move around your lands!" **(Quest - Deliver 250 birch, 100 oak, 300 stone, 100 coal)**

2. **Mule**: Given to the player at the beginning of the game. Slower than other mounts.

3. **Pig**: Appears after the player buys 5 pigs.

### Perks
In the workshop, there will be a separate section for perks that players can acquire using resources.

#### Tool Perk (Axe, Pickaxe): 

Double Yield - Grants a chance to harvest 2 resources instead of one. Can be upgraded 5 times at a 4% increase each. 

Each upgrade is available at every 10 levels of progress in lumberjacking or mining. (New upgrade becomes available after the previous one; however, it won't allow upgrades if the player doesn't have the required tool according to the check.)

- +4%: 100 coal / 200 oak (available immediately)
- +4%: 15 iron / 400 birch (requires a tool with 10 levels of work)
- +4%: 20 silver / 600 spruce (requires a tool with 20 levels of work)
- +4%: 25 gold / 800 dark oak (requires a tool with 30 levels of work)
- +4%: 30 titanium / 1200 tropical wood (requires a tool with 40 levels of work)

#### Mount Speed Boost (All Mounts): 

Enhanced Horseshoes - Grants mounts an increased speed of 10% per upgrade. (New upgrade becomes available after the previous one.)

- +10%: 20 iron
- +10%: 25 copper
- +10%: 30 silver
- +10%: 35 gold
- +10%: 40 platinum

## Tools

- Players have three tools: an axe, a pickaxe, and a fishing rod. The axe and pickaxe are given from the start, while the player purchases the fishing rod from the blacksmith's shop.

- When a player reaches every 10th level of the corresponding skill (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), the tool can be upgraded in the workshop using money and time. 

- Upgrades to tools affect the types of blocks obtained by the axe and pickaxe, while upgrading the fishing rod allows catching new types of fish. 

- Tools can only be upgraded after reaching the required skill level. The player enters the workshop, spends money, and waits for a specific time to upgrade the tool. 

- When a player submits a tool to the workshop, the tool temporarily disappears from their inventory and returns improved after the upgrade time has passed.

# Daily Quest System

Daily quests were part of last season's design document and are carried over unchanged into this season.

---

## General Overview

The system involves villagers who are related to the NPCs on the farm.

Each villager will have their own route (with time intervals between points ranging from 30-120 seconds) and variations of quests.

Each NPC will have unique quests.

The quests will be divided into two categories: **seasonal** and **holiday**. Additionally, a special guest will randomly visit once per in-game year, offering special rewards.

Players will not receive quests for items that they have not yet unlocked.

Quests refresh once every in-game week (7 real hours).

There will be 30 total villagers, but every 2 seasons (fall-winter, spring-summer) there will be a rotation of villagers. Only 12 villagers can be present on a farm at a time, and every 2 seasons, a random selection of villagers will be rotated from the pool. There will be 3 special guests.

Villagers cannot appear in two consecutive rotations (they can only return after skipping one).

The same quest cannot appear twice in a row for the same villager (it can only appear after skipping one).

---

## Seasonal Quests

Seasonal quests are the regular version of the quests. Each NPC will have a quest related to their role on the farm and their connection to the main characters, as well as the current rotation (2 seasons).

Each villager will have a pool of 4 quests per rotation, one of which will be chosen at random.

For example, Vanechka’s wife visits the farm in winter. Since she comes from a warm place, she will need a sweater and some hibiscus tea.

---

## Holiday Quests

Holiday quests will appear one in-game week before the end of any holiday (for example, if the farm's birthday ends on September 19, and starts on September 16, the holiday quests will appear on September 13).

For each holiday, each villager will have a pool of 2 quests.

For example: After the New Year’s celebration, Andrew noticed that he’s short on eggs and cheese for his holiday salads.

---

## Special Guests

Once per in-game year, one of the three special guests will visit the farm.

The special guest will stay on the farm for one in-game week.

The player must be online for the guest to appear.

Special guests will offer unique quests (not just collecting items) and will offer different rewards as well.

Their arrival does not cancel other quests; their quests will be displayed separately.

They will not move around the farm but will stand in a fixed location.

A special guest cannot appear two in-game years in a row (only after skipping one).

Each special guest will have a pool of 3 quests.

---

## Types of Quests

- **Collect items/resources/money:** Example: Turn in 100 iron to an NPC in exchange for a booster; turn in 10 shawarmas, and you’ll get a membership.
  
- **Perform an action:** Example: Chop down 100 trees. Mow 500 grass. Brew a potion. Catch 10 fish.

- **Deliver an item:** Example: Take a shawarma and deliver it to Konstantin, or grab a fur coat and deliver it to Natasha.

# Jewelry Mechanics Update from 11.10.2024

Jewelry can no longer be sold - they are now meant to be gifted to NPCs responsible for purchasing plants (or trees). You can gift as many pieces of jewelry as you want, but each subsequent jewelry given to the same NPC has a diminishing effect.

To gift jewelry, you must own at least 1 purchased crop of the corresponding type.

Some jewelry has been removed. Here is the updated list of jewelry:

- Copper Bracelet
- Silver Brooch
- Gold Earrings
- Amethyst Brooch
- Emerald Pendant
- Diamond Ring

---

## Bonus List for Gifting Jewelry to NPCs:

- **Silver Brooch** - Gives a chance for the plant (and water reserves in the barrel, if any) to resist drought – improves up to 40%.
  
- **Gold Earrings** - Speeds up the production time of the associated crop (e.g., wheat will be produced faster than once per minute) – up to a -25% reduction in production time.
  
- **Amethyst Brooch** - Reduces the cost of plants of that crop type, without negatively affecting the farm's value – up to a 10% discount.
  
- **Emerald Pendant** - Increases the passive income from that crop – up to +10%.
  
- **Diamond Ring** - Gives a chance for the crop to spawn instead of grass. When broken, it gives money like grass, but additionally grants the player an amount equal to the income from that crop – up to 2%.

---

## Copper Bracelet Special Effect:

When given to a specific NPC, it provides a buff to the entire farm. Here is a list of crops and their corresponding buffs:

- **Wheat** - Increases income from grass - up to +5%.
  
- **Potatoes** - Increases player movement speed - up to +10%.
  
- **Cucumbers** - Reduces the cost of upgrading tools - up to -60%.
  
- **Sugar Cane** - Increases income from cargo - up to +10%.
  
- **Tea Leaf** - Chance to get twice the materials when mining ore - up to 20%.
  
- **Onions** - Chance to get twice the amount of wood when chopping trees - up to 20%.
  
- **Grapes** - Increases the chance of positive events - up to +10%.
  
- **Raspberries** - Reduces the chance of negative events - up to -5%.
  
- **Cotton** - Reduces the time needed to combo grass - up to -20%.
  
- **Strawberries** - Reduces smelting time - up to -20%.
  
- **Carnations** - Increases digging speed - up to +10%.
  
- **Flax** - Reduces processing time - up to -10%.
  
- **Corn** - Reduces the production time of jewelry - up to -15%.
  
- **Sunflower** - Increases the chance of the "Productivity" event - up to +20%.
  
- **Cocoa Beans** - Increases animal product production speed - up to -10% from production time.
  
- **Hops** - Reduces the money required to pay off taxes - up to -30%.
  
- **Rose** - Increases passive income - up to +5%.
  
- **Tomatoes** - Further increases income from all fish processing - up to +20%.
  
- **Chrysanthemums** - Increases the chance of the "Bloom" event - up to +20%.
  
- **Blueberries** - Reduces the average time needed to catch fish - up to -20%.
  
- **Brown Mushroom** - Increases the chance of the "Mushroom Rain" event - up to +20%.
  
- **Rice** - Reduces the amount of experience needed to level up professions - up to -15%.
  
- **Cinnamon** - Reduces the time required to cure the "Flu" - up to -30%.
  
- **Apple** - Increases the average cargo weight per area - up to +20%.
  
- **Peach** - Reduces the prices of all crops (again, without negatively affecting the farm's value) - up to -5%.
  
- **Pear** - Increases the chance of combo-grass triggering - an additional 1% chance.
  
- **Orange** - Increases the value of processed products - up to +15%.
  
- **Coconut** - Grants a chance to catch 2 fish at once - up to +30%.

The more jewelry of a specific type that an NPC receives, the higher the chance for the buff to increase. The chance grows with each additional piece of jewelry (geometric progression).

---

## Explanation of How the Buff Chance Increases

The chance grows following a geometric progression formula. It is calculated using the following simple formula:

In this formula:
- **b₁** is the first term of the sequence, or the buff granted by the very first piece of jewelry given of that type.
- **q** is the multiplier by which the buff increases with each subsequent piece of jewelry of the same type given to the NPC.
- **n** is the number of jewelry pieces given to that NPC.

Let’s walk through an example:

Suppose we want to calculate the buff provided by Copper Bracelets gifted to an NPC in charge of wheat (let’s call him Konstantin). We’ll assume that the first bracelet gives a 1% buff to grass income (this is **b₁**), and each subsequent bracelet gives 0.8 times the previous one (so the second bracelet gives 0.8%, the third gives 0.64%, and so on). In this case, 0.8 is **q**. Finally, we just need to substitute **n** – the number of Copper Bracelets given to Konstantin – to calculate the total percentage increase in grass income.

---

## Configuration and Data Storage

In the config files, two values will be stored, which will vary for each NPC and each type of jewelry:
- **b₁** (the first buff).
- **q** (the buff multiplier).

As for **n** (the number of jewelry pieces given), it will be stored in the database and will differ for each player, depending on how many pieces of jewelry they have gifted. **n** will be different for each piece of jewelry and each NPC (leading to 28 * 6 values per player).

---

## Jewelry Crafting and Interaction

The ability to sell jewelry should be removed. Now, jewelry can only be crafted. When interacting with an NPC while holding the sprint button, a menu will appear where the player can choose how many jewelry pieces of each type they want to gift.

### Potion Brewing - Update from 11.09.2024
Potion brewing is a new feature in **MyLittleFarm** that allows players to brew various potions. To start, players must build the **Witch's Cottage**, which requires the following materials: 
- Stone
- Iron
- Birch wood
- Witch's Cottage Blueprint

This building also introduces an NPC named **Morgana**.

#### How Potion Brewing Works
A cauldron filled with water serves as the primary tool for brewing. Players "throw" ingredients into the cauldron, selecting them from a special storage (accessible through a dedicated menu). This storage holds all the materials available for brewing, which can also be sold or used for other purposes (this is handled in a separate menu for crafted potions).

Once the ingredients are added, the brewing process begins, visualized by particles, and a **hologram** displays information about the brewing potion and its production progress.

**Note:** Only one potion can be active at a time. If a player uses a potion, they cannot drink another while the effects of the first potion are active—**effects do not stack**.

#### Ingredients for Potions

- **Grass Gathering** (drop chance):
  - **Hellebore** (0.5%)
  - **Clover** (0.5%)
  - **Amanita** (0.5%)

- **Mining** (drop chance):
  - **Coal Dust** (coal, 4%)
  - **Ground Quartz** (quartz, 3%)
  - **Gold Nugget** (gold, 2.75%)
  - **Emerald Shard** (emerald, 2.5%)
  - **Crushed Obsidian** (obsidian, 2%)

- **Lumberjacking** (drop chance):
  - **Oak Bark** (oak, 4%)
  - **Wood Dust** (any wood, 5%)
